# Homework 13: E-Commerce Back End


## Description

I further developed code to create the e-commerce back end for a site, which allows the user to:
* Utilize GET routes to view all categories, products, and tags, and to view specific categories, products, and tags.
* Utilize POST routes to update specific categories, products, and tags.
* Utilize DELETE routes to delete specific categories, products, and tags.
